Welcome Philipp!

You will initially manage product development, curate trader community, and run monthly campaigns. Later, you may as well engage business development, build partnership integrations, and grow marketing reach.

You are expected for startup-like long hours and relentless dedication. You should synchronize daily with the global team, in particular some overlapping hours during 9am to 7pm California hours. We work during weekends but not necessarily with scheduled meetings.
